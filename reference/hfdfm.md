# Estimate a high-frequency dynamic factor model

Estimates the Bayesian mixed-frequency dynamic factor model behind the
Swiss Weekly Activity Index (WAI) by Markov chain Monte Carlo (Gibbs)
sampling. Flow and stock indicator series of different frequencies are
combined into a single weekly activity factor that is coherent with the
low-frequency target series (typically quarterly real GDP), from which
weekly GDP nowcasts are derived.

## Usage

``` r
hfdfm(
  flows,
  stocks,
  target,
  p = 1,
  q = 1,
  length_sample = 10000,
  burn_in = 1000,
  thinning = 1,
  plots = FALSE,
  extend_to = NULL,
  stochastic_volatility = TRUE,
  serial_correlation = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- flows:

  Named list of `ts` objects treated as flow variables. Must contain
  `target`.

- stocks:

  Named list of `ts` objects treated as stock variables.

- target:

  Character, name of the low-frequency target series in `flows` (e.g.
  `"ch.seco.gdp.real.gdp.ssa"`).

- p:

  Integer, number of factor lags in the factor state equation.

- q:

  Integer, number of factors. Currently ignored: the sampler always uses
  a single factor.

- length_sample:

  Integer, number of posterior draws to keep.

- burn_in:

  Integer, number of initial draws to discard.

- thinning:

  Integer, keep every `thinning`-th draw after burn-in.

- plots:

  Logical, if `TRUE` draw base-graphics diagnostic plots of the data and
  of factor/volatility convergence during sampling.

- extend_to:

  Numeric (decimal time) or `NULL`. If beyond the sample end, the
  dataset is extended with zeros so forecasts can be produced.

- stochastic_volatility:

  Logical. Currently ignored: the sampler always includes stochastic
  volatility. Kept for API compatibility.

- serial_correlation:

  Logical. Currently ignored: the sampler always models serial
  correlation in measurement errors. Kept for API compatibility.

## Value

An object of class `"hfdfm"`: a list with components

- factor:

  `ts`, posterior mean of the annualized activity factor.

- factor_var:

  `ts`, posterior variance of the factor.

- index:

  `ts`, posterior mean of the cumulated activity index.

- nowcast:

  `ts`, posterior mean nowcast of the target series.

- nowcast_var:

  `ts`, posterior variance of the nowcast.

- target:

  Character, the target series name.

- pars:

  List of posterior parameter means (`h`, `lambda`, `phi`, `sigma`,
  `omega`, `rho`, `rho_var`).

- data:

  `ts` matrix of the prepared (standardized) data.

- data_augmented:

  `ts` matrix of the augmented dataset.

- inventory:

  Data frame describing the series (see
  [`create_inventory()`](https://philippkronenberg.github.io/wai_ind_package/reference/create_inventory.md)).

## Details

The factor is identified by fixing its loading on `target` to one and
shrinking the target's measurement-error variance and autocorrelation
toward zero (informative priors), so the extracted factor closely tracks
the observed growth rate of `target` rather than being merely correlated
with it. This resolves the usual scale/sign indeterminacy of dynamic
factor models and yields a directly interpretable high-frequency proxy
for the target series (see Kronenberg 2026, Sect. 2.4). All other series
are standardized and enter with uninformative priors. Missing and
lower-frequency observations are estimated as latent states via data
augmentation; the factor state equation includes stochastic volatility,
and measurement errors are quasi-differenced to remove serial
correlation (see `@references`).
