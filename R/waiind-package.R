#' waiind: A High-Frequency GDP Indicator for Switzerland
#'
#' Estimates the Weekly Activity Index (WAI): a weekly GDP indicator for
#' Switzerland derived from a Bayesian mixed-frequency dynamic factor
#' model ([hfdfm()]) that combines conventional macroeconomic indicators
#' with alternative high-frequency data (mobility, transactions, search
#' trends, and similar series) at weekly, monthly and quarterly
#' frequencies.
#'
#' @section Model in brief:
#' The model extracts a single dynamic factor, constrained by an
#' identification restriction that fixes its loading on GDP to one, so
#' the factor is directly interpretable as weekly GDP growth rather than
#' a generic activity index. Three features let it combine
#' heterogeneous, incomplete high-frequency data with official GDP
#' figures:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item **Data augmentation** treats missing and mixed-frequency
#'     observations as latent states, so series can enter with
#'     different starting dates, publication lags and frequencies
#'     (weekly, monthly, quarterly).
#'   \item **Stochastic volatility** in the factor state equation lets
#'     the variance of common shocks vary over time, so crisis-period
#'     swings (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic) are not mechanically smoothed
#'     away.
#'   \item **Quasi-differencing** (Chib & Greenberg, 1994) removes
#'     serial correlation in the measurement errors, preventing
#'     persistent idiosyncratic noise in individual indicators from
#'     contaminating the common factor.
#' }
#' Estimation is by Gibbs sampling using the precision sampler of Chan
#' and Jeliazkov (2009), with temporal aggregation of flow variables
#' following the geometric-mean approximation of Mariano and Murasawa
#' (2003).
#'
#' @section Getting started:
#' The package ships the curated indicator datasets [data_ch_dataset]
#' and [data_ch_dataset_test], plus the real-time GDP vintage database
#' (in `inst/extdata/`), so a small nowcast can be estimated out of the
#' box - see `vignette("waiind")` for a worked walkthrough, or the
#' example in [hfdfm()] for the minimal version.
