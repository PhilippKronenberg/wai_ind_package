#' Harmonized Swiss indicator dataset for the WAI model
#'
#' The curated, model-ready dataset produced by the data preparation
#' pipeline in `data-raw/1_data_prep_dataset.R`. Mixed-frequency time
#' series are harmonized to the project conventions (weekly series use
#' 48 observations per year) and transformed according to the variable
#' metadata in `data-raw/data_meta.xlsx`.
#'
#' @format A list with two components, as expected by `hfdfm()`:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{flows}{Named list of 45 `ts` objects treated as flow
#'     variables. The quarterly GDP target series is *not* included;
#'     the analysis scripts add it at runtime from the real-time GDP
#'     vintage database that ships with the package at
#'     `system.file("extdata", "realtime_database_GDP.xlsx", package = "waiind")`
#'     (see `get_real_time_gdp_vintages()`).}
#'   \item{stocks}{Named list of 7 `ts` objects treated as stock
#'     variables.}
#' }
#' @source Produced from SECO, KOF, FSO, SNB, Datastream and further
#'   high-frequency sources; see `data-raw/README_data_prep_dataset.md`
#'   for the per-series preprocessing choices.
"data_ch_dataset"

#' Harmonized Swiss indicator dataset (test variant)
#'
#' A variant of [data_ch_dataset] built from the test metadata
#' (`data_meta_test.xlsx`) with a different flow/stock split, used for
#' model development and evaluation runs.
#'
#' @format A list with two components, as expected by `hfdfm()`:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{flows}{Named list of 28 `ts` objects treated as flow
#'     variables, including the quarterly target series
#'     `ch.seco.gdp.real.gdp.ssa`.}
#'   \item{stocks}{Named list of 18 `ts` objects treated as stock
#'     variables.}
#' }
#' @source See [data_ch_dataset].
